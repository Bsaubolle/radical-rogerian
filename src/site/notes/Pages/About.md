### Clinician Hat
I am learning the craft of professional counseling, on my way to licensure in Northern California.  
  
I have two overlapping specializations: one, for children and teens―especially in school environments, leveraging family and educational systems for a student's wellbeing.  
  
The second, and more relevant for this site, is [[Posts/Defining the Radical Rogerian\|my approach as a Radical Rogerian.]] Carl Rogers, the father of modern counseling, laid the foundation of what it means to be an interpersonal healer: **Namely, that the healing relationship requires unconditional positive regard, warmth, empathy, and a relentless desire to understand the worldview of the other.**  
### Contemplative Hat
This approach to counseling is complemented and bolstered by my meditative training. As a practitioner, I mostly fall into the [Pragmatic Dharma](https://web.archive.org/web/20150811001451/http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2011/06/the-core-features-of-pragmatic-dharma/) camp of [Buddhist Modernism,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_modernism) as the majority of my practice has been cultivating insight a la [Ingram](https://www.mctb.org/), [Burbea](https://archive.is/wip/lg3bI), and other wonderful/wild/compassionate teachers.  
  
But my graduate training in the Humanities, coupled with some DP/DR experiences, somewhat broke my spell of infatuation with attainments and progress toward "A Big Goal" such as Enlightenment or\ Awakening. As I continue to experience [[Posts/Reflections on Depersonalization-Derealization\|derealization episodes]], practice has shifted and mutated and broadened to much more than simply sitting.  

***In fact, I view my clinical work as the next frontier of contemplative development.*** 

I owe this blooming perspective to the work of [Matthew O'Connell and the Imperfect Buddha,](https://thebuddhistcentre.com/news/memory-rob-burbea) as it exposed me to new critiques and conceptions of practice that include the immediate, the social, and the local. 
## Integration
The purpose of this site is to integrate these two domains, as I already act with the understanding that they are intimately connected. Thinking through this integration means considering the ideological, ethical, and practical dimensions of the conversation between [[Posts/Perspective on Counseling and Contemplation\|counseling and contemplation.]]
