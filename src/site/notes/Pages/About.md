# About

## Logistics of the Site
On the ==left sidebar,== you will be presented with folders. Currently, here is the list of folders in order of utility for navigating this site:

- =="Pages"== - The basic map-style pages you find in many blogs. For the traditional blog-style feel, I recommend [[Pages/Posts\|Posts]] (relatively independent essays) and [[Pages/Reading\|Reading]] (summaries of content I'm consuming, with highlights/extracts). 
  > [!aside|right +++++]
>  [1] Maybe fun to just scroll through and sees what tickles your fancy?
- =="Posts" and "Readings"== - these are the folders that contain the entries for both categories. They are organized alphabetically and contain a flat hierarchy (i.e., no subfolders to organize by content).[1]
  
- =="Index"== - Notes that point to many other notes. They are usually concepts, very high level. 

With time, I will create queries (or lists) that will help organize the pages, posts, and concepts. [[Pages/Reading\|Reading]] is perhaps the most "diary-like," as the entries will be chronological.

On the ==right sidebar,== you currently[2] have two views: "On this page," which are headers that organize the document, and "Pages mentioning this page," which is the primary fuel source for this website. Otherwise known as [[Backlinks\|Backlinking]], this view shows all the posts/readings/concepts that link to the current note. This is a central feature in modern note-taking tools, such as [[Obsidian.md\|Obsidian.md]] (my preferred tool, and how I'm publishing this website). 

In the future, I will probably create posts on [[Personal Knowledge Management Systems\|Personal Knowledge Management Systems]], or PKMS. The tools we use really *do* change the ways we think―as in the [[4e\|extended mind thesis]] proposed by cognitive scientists and philosophers of consciousness like [David Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers#Philosophy_of_mind). 

## Me as Clinician & Human
### Clinician Hat
I am learning the craft of professional counseling, on my way to licensure in Northern California.  
  
I have two overlapping specializations: one, for children and teens―especially in school environments, leveraging family and educational systems for a student's wellbeing.  
  
The second, and more relevant for this site, is [[Posts/Defining the Radical Rogerian\|my approach as a Radical Rogerian.]] Carl Rogers, the father of modern counseling, laid the foundation of what it means to be an interpersonal healer: **Namely, that the healing relationship requires unconditional positive regard, warmth, empathy, and a relentless desire to understand the worldview of the other.**  
### Contemplative Hat
This approach to counseling is complemented and bolstered by my meditative training. I mostly fall into the **Pragmatic Dharma** camp of **Buddhist Modernism,** as the majority of my practice has been cultivating insight a la Ingram, Burbea, and other wonderful/wild/compassionate teachers.  
  
But my graduate training in the Humanities, coupled with some DP/DR experiences, somewhat broke my spell of infatuation with attainments and progress toward "A Big Goal" such as Enlightenment or Awakening. As I continue to experience [[Posts/Reflections on Depersonalization-Derealization\|derealization episodes]], practice has shifted and mutated and broadened to much more than simply sitting.  

**In fact, I view my clinical work as the next frontier of contemplative development.** 

I owe this blooming perspective to the work of **Matthew O'Connell and the Imperfect Buddha,** as it exposed me to new critiques and conceptions of practice that include the immediate, the social, and the local. 
## Integration
The purpose of this site is to integrate these two domains, as I already act with the understanding that they are intimately connected. Thinking through this integration means considering the ideological, ethical, and practical dimensions of the conversation between [[Posts/Perspective on Counseling and Contemplation\|counseling and contemplation.]]
