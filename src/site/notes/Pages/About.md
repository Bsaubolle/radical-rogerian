# About
*cross-posted here: [link](https://radicalrogerian.blogspot.com/p/about.html)*

## Clinician Hat
I am learning the craft of professional counseling, on my way to licensure in Northern California.  
  
I have two overlapping specializations: one, for children and teens―especially in school environments, leveraging family and educational systems for a student's wellbeing.  
  
The second, and more relevant for this site, is [[Defining the Radical Rogerian\|my approach as a Radical Rogerian.]] Carl Rogers, the father of modern counseling, laid the foundation of what it means to be an interpersonal healer: **Namely, that the healing relationship requires unconditional positive regard, warmth, empathy, and a relentless desire to understand the worldview of the other.**  

## Contemplative Hat
This approach to counseling is complemented and bolstered by my meditative training. I mostly fall into the **Pragmatic Dharma** camp of **Buddhist Modernism,** as the majority of my practice has been cultivating insight a la Ingram, Burbea, and other wonderful/wild/compassionate teachers.  
  
But my graduate training in the Humanities, coupled with some DP/DR experiences, somewhat broke my spell of infatuation with attainments and progress toward "A Big Goal" such as Enlightenment or Awakening. As I continue to experience [[Reflections on Depersonalization-Derealizationdestabilization due to DP/DR,\|Reflections on Depersonalization-Derealizationdestabilization due to DP/DR,]] practice has shifted and mutated and broadened to much more than simply sitting.  

**In fact, I view my clinical work as the next frontier of contemplative development.**  

I owe this blooming perspective to the work of **Matthew O'Connell and the Imperfect Buddha,** as it exposed me to new critiques and conceptions of practice that include the immediate, the social, and the local. 

## Integration
The purpose of the blog is to integrate these two domains, as I already act with the understanding that they are intimately connected. Thinking through this integration means to consider the ideological, ethical, and practical dimensions of the conversation between counseling and contemplation.
