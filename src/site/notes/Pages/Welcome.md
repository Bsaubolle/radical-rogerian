# Welcome
This [[Index/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]] is the primary place for me to strand together thoughts on counseling and contemplation in an interdisciplinary (and so very messy) endeavor. Some of the posts will be in development; others will be complete essays. ***If you are new, I highly recommend checking the [[Pages/Logistics of the Site\|Logistics of the Site]] and [[Pages/About\|About]] pages for more information.*** *There will be some "dead" links—these are posts or pages that I haven't yet published.*

Otherwise, jump into my [[Pages/Reading\|current readings]], or check out some [[Pages/Posts\|recent posts]]. 

Grab a coffee, sit back, and enjoy :)
