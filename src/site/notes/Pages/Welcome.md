# Welcome
This [[Index/Digital Garden\|Digital Garden]] is the primary place for me to strand together thoughts on counseling and contemplation in an interdisciplinary (and so very messy) endeavor. Some of the posts will be in development; others will be complete essays. **If you are new, I highly recommend checking the [[Pages/About\|About]] page for more information.** (*disclaimer: there will be some "dead" linksâ€”these are posts or pages that I haven't yet published.*)

Otherwise, jump into my [[Pages/Reading\|current readings]], or check out some [[Pages/Posts\|recent posts]]. 

Grab a coffee, sit back, and enjoy :)
