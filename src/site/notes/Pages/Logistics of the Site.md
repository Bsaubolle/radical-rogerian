# Logistics of the Site
On the ==left sidebar,== you will be presented with folders. Currently, here is the list of folders in order of utility for navigating this site:

- =="Pages"== - The basic map-style pages you find in many blogs. For the traditional blog-style feel, I recommend [[Pages/Posts\|Posts]] (relatively independent essays) and [[Pages/Reading\|Reading]] (summaries of content I'm consuming, with highlights/extracts). 

- =="Posts" and "Readings"== - these are the folders that contain the entries for both categories. They are organized alphabetically and contain a flat hierarchy (i.e., no subfolders to organize by content).
  
- =="Index"== - Notes that point to many other notes. They are usually concepts, very high level. 

With time, I will create queries (or lists) that will help organize the pages, posts, and concepts. [[Pages/Reading\|Reading]] is perhaps the most "diary-like," as the entries will be chronological.

At the ==bottom of the page,== you currently***[1]*** have an additional view: "Backlinks," which is the primary fuel source for this website. Otherwise known as [[Backlinks\|Backlinking]], this view shows all the posts/readings/concepts that link to the current note. This is a central feature in modern note-taking tools, such as [[Obsidian.md\|Obsidian.md]] (my preferred tool, and how I'm publishing this website). 

In the future, I will probably create posts on [[Personal Knowledge Management Systems\|Personal Knowledge Management Systems]], or PKMS. The tools we use really *do* change the ways we think―as in the [[4e\|extended mind thesis]] proposed by cognitive scientists and philosophers of consciousness like [David Chalmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chalmers#Philosophy_of_mind). 

### Disclaimer
Unfortunately, if you are viewing the site on mobile, you will miss some *sidenotes* context. Sidenotes are just like Footnotes, except placed in the margin immediately next to the paragraph. Usually, they are trite comments, or fun pictures―you will still be able to read the pages. In some mobile browsers (like Brave), you can toggle to "View Desktop Site." Until I fix this (which I may not be able to), reading it on your laptop or desktop computer is your best bet.
